# mixin_colourable.rb
#
# A mixin from Ahnlak's DRGrabBag
#
# Adds in r/g/b/a attributes, along with functions to set those channels and
# fade them to new values over time.
#
# Usage: include as `include Ahnlak::MixinColourable`
#
# rgba values can then be set with colourable / colourable_array
#
# If the speed parameter is included, ensure to call update every tick to
# slowly fade to the specified colour
#
