# mixin_movable.rb
#
# A mixin from Ahnlak's DRGrabBag
#
# Adds in x/y/w/h/angle attributes, along with functions to set positions and
# dimensions, along with suitable tweening
#
# Usage: include as `include Ahnlak::MixinMovable`
#
# xy values can then be set with movable_location
# wh values can be set with movable_size
# angle values can be set with movable_angle
#
# If the speed parameter is included, ensure to call update every tick to
# slowly transition to the new values
#
# Note that not all parameter apply to all primitives (ie labels don't rotate)
#
