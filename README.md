MiniGameJam
===========

These are all minigames developed as part of the impending TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam.

They are all developed using version 1.22 of DragonRuby, but in theory should be compatible
with other versions :-)

In Development
--------------

**vertices** is a 20 second true minigame, where you click the shape with the fewest edges.

This was pretty much developed as an experiment to see what I could come up with that
fit into the fairly restrictive definition of a mini game. As it turns out, it's actually
rather a fun little thing with a strong 'one more go' appeal.

The basic graphics are all mine. Sorry.

The font and icons come from [Kenney's Game Assets](https://kenney.nl), whose asset packs
are a fantastic resource.

The music comes from [Subspace Audio](https://juhanijunkala.com/), via 
[OpenGameArg.org](https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action)



Future Games
------------

* elevate; climb as high as possible by jumping up the moving, spike-tipped platforms. But don't dawdle, because platforms speed up the longer you're stood on them!

* snake; a repeat of that most ancient phone-based game

* purple turtles; a classic c64-era jumping game
