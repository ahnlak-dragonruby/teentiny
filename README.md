MiniGameJam
===========

These are all minigames developed as part of the impending TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam.

They are all developed using version 1.22 of DragonRuby, but in theory should be compatible
with other versions :-)

* elevate; climb as high as possible by jumping up the moving, spike-tipped platforms. But don't dawdle, because platforms speed up the longer you're stood on them!

* snake; a repeat of that most ancient phone-based game

* purple turtles; a classic c64-era jumping game

* vertices; a 20 second true minigame, where you click the shape with the fewest edges
