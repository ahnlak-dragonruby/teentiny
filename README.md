MiniGameJam
===========

These are all minigames developed as part of the impending TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam.

They are all developed using version 1.27 of DragonRuby, but in theory should be compatible
with later versions :-)


Complete Games
--------------

**vertices** is a 20 second true minigame, where you click the shape with the fewest edges.

This was pretty much developed as an experiment to see what I could come up with that
fit into the fairly restrictive definition of a mini game. As it turns out, it's actually
rather a fun little thing with a strong 'one more go' appeal.

The basic graphics are all mine. Sorry.

The font, icons and sound effects come from [Kenney's Game Assets](https://kenney.nl), 
whose asset packs are a fantastic resource.

The music comes from [Subspace Audio](https://juhanijunkala.com/), via 
[OpenGameArg.org](https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action)


In Development
--------------

**adrift** is a simple 'stay on the screen' game. Your spaceship is adrift,
with an increasingly broken engine. Every time you fire it, it increases in
power.

The aim of the game is simple; keep your spaceship on the screen. How long can
you last?
